@Mario something I think will greatly help speed Lamdera adoption is if there was a default init template that had:
Backend Data examples
Pages with routing
A reused component on two pages to demonstrate composability
User + rights management
Rights gating to a page
An outgoing HTTP example
An incoming RPC example
A simplified OAuth implementation for Google specifically (via custom code, not the Auth module)
An example of using ports
An example of using a web component
