# Kitchen Sink

This is app is a template for Lamdera projects.
The repo is at  [github.com/jxxcarlson/kitchen-sink](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/kitchen-sink).

See the **Features** and **Note** tabs for more information. The first
of these lists the main features of the template and their status. The
second gives details on their implementation. The **Purchase** tab
allows you to make fake purchases using Stripe.  Your credit card
will not be charged â€” this is all done in test mode.

During the testing phase, the app comes preloaded with two users, `jxxcarlson`
and `aristotle`, both with password `1234`. Use the **Sign in** tab for these.
You can also sign up for your own account.

Note that you can play administrator by signing in as `jxxcarlson`. When signed
is as an administrator, the **Admin** tab appears.  Using it, you
can display the current users, Stripe data, and a key-value store.  You can
put data into and get data out of the key-value store using remote
procedure calls (RPCs).

Below are four short examples: (a) the first button plays a sound,
(b) the second copies some hidden text to the clipboard, (c)
the third displays the current temperature in of the city
that you type into the white box (press `Enter` when done).
The fourth displays the current local time
using a simple, self-contained custom element (web component).
The first two example use ports, while the second relies
on an outbound Http request to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)
from the backend.  See the `Ports`, `Weather`, and `View.CustomElement` modules for code
and for more information.

**NOTE.** *The "View Data" and "Edit Data" tabs are for another project
(a curated public data service for science and education) and will be removed when this project is complete.*
