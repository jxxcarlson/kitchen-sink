# Kitchen Sink

This is app is a template for Lamdera projects.
The repo is at  [github.com/jxxcarlson/kitchen-sink](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/kitchen-sink).

See the **Features** and **Note** tabs for more information. The first
of these lists the main features of the template and their status. The
 second gives details on their implementation. The **Purchase** tab
 allows you to make fake purchases using Stripe.  Your credit card
 will not be charged â€” this is all done in test mode.

 During the testing phase, the app comes preloaded with two users, `jxxcarlson`
 and `aristotle`, both with password `1234`. Use the **Sign in** tab for these.
 You can also sign up for your own account.

 Note that you can play administrator by signing in as `jxxcarlson`. When signed
 is as an administrator, the **Admin** tab appears.  Using it, you
 can display the current users, Stripe data, and a key-value store.

 *In this initial phase, I will sometimes do destructive migrations. Consequently
 all data except that which is preloaded will be lost.*

 Below are examples of how one uses ports to (a) play a sound and (b) copy text to the clipboard.
