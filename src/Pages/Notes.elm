The Kitchen Sink Template is a template for creating Lamdera apps
which has a lot of features already set up for you.

## Adding a new page

Suppose that you want to add a new page for notes to your app.
You must first set up and configure a the route for the page.
Define a new variant `Notes` for the type
`Route` in `Routes.elm`.
Then follow the compiler errors to update the functions
`decode : Url -> Route`
and
`encode : Route -> String` in that module.

Next, add a new module `Pages.Notes`, put some
draft content in it, import it into module
`Frontend`, and add an entry in the
function `Frontend.update` to handle the
new route.

If you want to add a link to the new page in the
footer, add something like the below to
`Pages.Parts.footer`:

```elm
Element.link [] { url = Route.encode Notes, label = Element.text "Notes" }
```

Another possibility is to add a link to `Pages.parts.header`:
